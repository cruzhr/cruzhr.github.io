            <div class="description">
                <p>Saint Bernard English School is built on the principle that “education is the kindling of a flame not
                    the
                    filling of a vessel” (Plutarch). We seek to kindle and re-kindle that fire or passion for learning
                    English.
                    We believe in a qualitative approach to learning, i.e. being able to understand and express in
                    English
                    rather than focus on the quantitative aspect.</p>
                <p>It is with this vision that we started St Bernard English School: to provide a place and a space
                    where
                    not
                    only children but adults as well can learn to love English and various cultures of English-speaking
                    countries and learn them by heart.</p>

            <p>At Saint Bernard, we strive to live up with our motto by providing our willing students a nonpareil,
                quality but affordable English education. At St. Bernard, we hope that young students can discover their
                passion for learning English, be able to invent themselves into thinking more creatively and critically
                in a foreign language; adult students can re-discover their power and passion for English, and be able
                to re-invent themselves into more proactive communicants and English speakers. </p>
